The goal of this project is to test the complexity of queries that can be run in PostgreSQL 13 against a database made up of a number of smaller datasets from the real estate company Zillow. 
 
This project will give us the opportunity to test the following concepts learned in class: 
	
•	Ability to design a conceptual model (ER diagram) for a real-world data set 
•	Ability to translate a conceptual model into a SQL schema 
•	Ability to create a PostgreSQL Database
•	Ability to write proper SQL queries 
•	Ability to show the analysis of SQL queries
